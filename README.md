# Forge Template from RoBaertschi

This is a simple forge template using Architectury Loom.

I took heavy copy inspiration from (I took that from [here](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/create-multiloader-addon-template/)).
Huge Thanks to the Fabricators of Crate for a really useful Template.

Replace all stuff, to make this template yours.
Following files should you look at:
* [mods.toml](src/main/resources/META-INF/mods.toml) Change with your information
* [examplemod.mixins.json](src/main/resources/examplemod.mixins.json) Rename and change information
* [gradle.properties](gradle.properties) Update all the fields and if you want also the dependencies versions

Don't forget the packets.

Here is a List of some useful features:
* Automatic jar compressing when pushing to github repository using Machete (I took that from [here](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/create-multiloader-addon-template/))
* Easy registering using Registrate
* Multiple mappings for full mapped sources (I took that from [here](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/create-multiloader-addon-template/))
* JEI already here
